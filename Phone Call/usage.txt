Phone Call Script Usage
=======================

Prerequisites:
1. Install 'Termux' and 'Termux:API' on your Android device from F-Droid or Play Store.
2. Open Termux and run: `pkg install termux-api python`

Running the script:
1. Run with python directly:
   python phone_call.py

2. Run with a specific number:
   python phone_call.py +1234567890

3. On Windows (Testing):
   Double-click `run.bat` to launch the script in a terminal window.

Note:
The actual dialing functionality only works on Android devices setup with Termux.
On other systems, it will simulate the call command.
